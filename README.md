# ModWarning

Tired of saying naughty words in discord servers and getting banned? I certainly was. So I created a simple solution. This script warns you if there is someone with admin in your voice channel.

FEATURES:
- Warn user with TTS when a Moderator joins the channel

TODO: 
- Automute upon admin joining
